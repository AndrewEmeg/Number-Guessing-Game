# Number-Guessing-Game
## Disclaimer
This project is one of the many projects in my current JavaScript course on Udemy as at May 14, 2024. I built this project by observing my instructor and implementing my observations in my code. The HTML and CSS were given to me as starter files, since it was a JavaScript course.

This is the [JavaScript Course](https://www.udemy.com/share/101Wfe/)

## Description:
This project is a simple number guessing game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game generates a random number between 1 and 20, and the player has to guess the number. It provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, and it keeps track of the score.

## Features

- Random number generation between 1 and 20
- Input field for player guesses
- Feedback messages for high, low, and correct guesses
- Score tracking with decrement on incorrect guesses
- High score tracking

## Usage
- Open the index.html file in your browser.
- Enter a guess in the input field and click the "Check!" button.
- The game will provide feedback on whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- Your score decreases with each incorrect guess.
- Click the "Again!" button to restart the game with a new random number, but with the highscore preserved.
