# Number-Guessing-Game
Description: This project is a simple number guessing game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game generates a random number between 1 and 20, and the player has to guess the number. It provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, and it keeps track of the score.
This project is one of the many projects from a JavaScript course on Udemy. I learned by observing my instructor and implemented in my code. The HTML and CSS were given to me as starter files, since it was a JavaScript course.
The course can be found on the [Udemy Website](https://www.udemy.com/share/101Wfe/)
