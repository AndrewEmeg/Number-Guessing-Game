## Disclaimer
This project is one of the many projects in my current JavaScript course on Udemy as at May 14, 2024. I built this project by observing my instructor and implementing my observations in my code. The HTML and CSS were given to me as starter files, since it was a JavaScript course.

This project is a simple number guessing game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game generates a random number between 1 and 20, and the player has to guess the number. It provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, and it keeps track of the score.
